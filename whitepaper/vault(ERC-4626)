# ERC-4626 yield bearing token specification

ERC-4626, the Tokenized Vault Standard, is a crucial advancement in decentralized finance (DeFi), designed to standardize how yield-bearing vaults operate. 

By extending the ERC-20 token standard, it introduces a unified framework that simplifies integration, improves security, and enhances interoperability across DeFi protocols. 

Users can deposit ERC-20 tokens into vaults and receive proportional shares, while vaults deploy strategies to generate yield. 

This consistency reduces complexity for developers and improves the user experience by enabling smoother interactions across platforms. 

Major DeFi projects like Yearn Finance and Balancer have already adopted ERC-4626, signaling its growing importance. 

As the DeFi space evolves, ERC-4626 is set to become a foundational standard for yield-generating applications.

ERC-4626 is a standard to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults. It provides a standard API for tokenized yield-bearing vaults that represent shares of a single underlying ERC-20 token. ERC-4626 also outlines an optional extension for tokenized vaults utilizing ERC-20, offering basic functionality for depositing, withdrawing tokens and reading balances.
