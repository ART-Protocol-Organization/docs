## 1. Protocol
### 1.1 Blockchain Mainnet
#### 1.1.1 Overview of PoS   
**PoS(Proof-of-Stake)** is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks. Unlike the traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) approach, PoS relies on the ownership of tokens and stake contributions to assign roles in block validation and creation.   
The core idea behind PoS is that network participants can "stake" their tokens, and based on the amount and duration of their stake, they are granted validator privileges. This mechanism enhances the decentralization and security of the blockchain while achieving significant energy efficiency.
#### 1.1.2 The Need for PoS   
- **Energy Efficiency**: PoW-based networks consume massive energy and raise environmental concerns. In contrast, PoS minimizes energy consumption by relying on staking rather than mining.
- **Scalability**: PoS reduces block generation time and increases transaction throughput, improving network scalability.
- **Enhanced Security**: An attacker would need to own at least 51% of the staked tokens to control the network, making such an attack prohibitively expensive and impractical.
#### 1.1.3 ART Protocol's PoS Mechanism   
The PoS mechanism adopted by ART Protocol aims to balance network stability and participant rewards through a fair and efficient design.   
1. **Validator Selection**  
    ART Protocol selects participants who have staked a certain amount of tokens as validators. This process is carried out fairly through a decentralized validation mechanism.
2. **Block Creation and Validation**  
    Validators are randomly chosen in specific intervals to generate blocks and validate transactions within the network. This is based on a probabilistic reward system proportional to their stake.
3. **Rewards and Penalties**   
    - **Rewards**: Validators earn network tokens as rewards for successfully creating and validating blocks. The reward amount depends on the staked token amount and the level of participation.
    - **Penalties (Slashing)**: If malicious behavior (e.g., double signing, validation failures) is detected, part or all of the validator’s staked tokens may be slashed or burned as punishment.
4. **Enhanced Security Mechanism**   
ART Protocol combines random validator selection and economic incentives to strengthen network security. To compromise the network, an attacker would need to acquire a majority of the staked tokens, making such attempts economically unfeasible.
#### 1.1.4 Advantages of ART Protocol's PoS
- **Eco-Friendly**: Unlike PoW, PoS requires no large-scale computations, resulting in near-zero carbon emissions.
- **Incentivized User Participation**: Anyone holding tokens can contribute to the network by staking and earn rewards.
- **Economic Efficiency**: The simplified validation and reward processes eliminate resource inefficiencies.
- **Maintaining Decentralization**: ART Protocol prevents centralization risks through staking participation and random validator selection.
#### 1.1.5 PoS Conclusion   
The PoS-based mainnet of ART Protocol is designed to build a sustainable and efficient blockchain network. By combining energy efficiency, security, and scalability, it establishes the foundation for next-generation blockchain technology while ensuring fairness and transparency for all network participants.   
#### 1.1.6 Asset Protocol   
Asset protocol "programmed rules for the movement and transaction of tokenized assets" operates on the Web3.0 and trade platform based on smart contracts on the decentralized computing of blockchain.

#### 1.2.3 Artcoin’s Blockchain Networks
- **Initial Launch on Ethereum** : Artcoin was initially launched on the Ethereum (ETH) network, a leading platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum provided a robust foundation with its extensive user base and strong security. However, as the network usage grew, challenges such as slower transaction speeds and higher gas fees emerged.
- **Migration to Polygon** : To address the issues of high fees and limited scalability, Artcoin transitioned to the Polygon (MATIC) network. Polygon, a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, enabled faster and more cost-effective transactions. This migration significantly improved the user experience by reducing fees and enhancing the network's overall efficiency.
- **Final Transition to Base** : To strengthen its presence in the U.S. market and provide an improved user experience, Artcoin moved to the Base network. Base, a Layer 2 solution supported by Coinbase, offers low fees and high scalability. Leveraging Coinbase's extensive user base and reputation, this transition allowed Artcoin to enhance accessibility and adoption within the U.S. market.
- **Planned Transition to a Proprietary Mainnet** : Artcoin is currently developing its own proprietary blockchain mainnet and plans to migrate once it is ready. The proprietary mainnet will enable Artcoin to achieve technical autonomy and provide users with an optimized transaction environment and enhanced scalability. This transition will mark a significant milestone in achieving full independence and strengthening the Artcoin ecosystem.   
**Through these network transitions and the development of its proprietary mainnet, Artcoin aims to deliver superior services and experiences to its users while bolstering its competitiveness in the global market.**
#### 1.2.4 Artcoin's Validator   
The Artcoin Validator program allows users to stake their coins and earn income from their deposits. This program includes the following terms and features:
1. **Basic Deposit Requirement** : Users who deposit a minimum of 150,000 Artcoins into the Validator will receive rewards for their staked coins over the course of one year.
2. **Reward Structure** : 
    - 4 Artcoins are distributed per hour.
    - Users can earn 96 Artcoins per day (24 hours).
    - Over one year (365 days), a total reward of 35,040 Artcoins is distributed.
3. **Profit Sharing** :
    - The total rewards are divided in a 7:3 ratio between users and operators.
    - Users receive 70% of the total rewards, while operators take 30%.
4. **Partial Staking Support** :
    - Users who cannot meet the 150,000 Artcoin threshold will still receive proportional rewards based on the amount staked.
5. **Income Rate Example** :
    - A user staking 150,000 Artcoins can expect an annual return of approximately 23.36%.
    - The effective income rate for the user's 70% share is approximately 16.35%.   
6. **Halving & unlock plan** :
    - Distribute amount per hour reduced to half, when total distributed amount reach to the half of total amount.
    - 1st unlock planned in late 2026, % will be released.
      
**This program is designed to enhance the Artcoin ecosystem and provide users with stable income opportunities.**

### 1.3 Tokenized RWA (Real World Asset)
#### 1.3.1 The Concept of WEB3 and RWA   
RWA (Real World Asset) refers to the digitalization of real-world assets, allowing them to be managed and traded on the blockchain. In WEB3, RWA is tokenized, enabling transparent recording and management of ownership, transaction history, and authentication on the blockchain.   
The tokenization of RWA offers several advantages :
1. **Transparency** : All transaction histories are recorded on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof.
2. **Accessibility** : Anyone can access and trade RWA through the blockchain network.
3. **Liquidity** : Assets with low liquidity in traditional markets can be digitized and traded more widely.
4. **Security** : Ownership of assets is securely managed through the decentralized ledger of the blockchain.
#### 1.3.2 ART Protocol’s RWA Authentication and Trading System   
Artcoin is transforming the traditional asset custody and trading system through its **NFT-based RWA authentication service**.
1. **NFT Authentication**
    - The Artcoin platform verifies RWAs, such as artworks, and issues NFTs representing these assets.
    - These NFTs contain ownership and authentication information, making it easy to verify the authenticity and ownership of assets.
2. **Custody and Trading System**
    - NFTs are traded on the blockchain, simplifying the transfer of ownership for RWAs.
    - Artcoin provides secure asset custody services and improves user experience by automating transactions via smart contracts.
3. **Scalability**
    - Currently, the service supports **artworks**, but it will expand to include other real-world assets like **tea** and **gold** in the future.
    - This expansion aims to support a broader RWA market and strengthen Artcoin's position in the global market.
      
#### 1.3.3 PoR (Proof of Reserve) 
PoR (Proof of Reserve) is the foundation of trust in RWA tokenization, transforming token promises into verifiable ownership of real-world assets.
